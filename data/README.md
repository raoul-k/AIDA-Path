Data used in the AIDA-Path Project

Some disorders are too complex and their binary representation too large to store (e.g. Major Depressive Disorder - MDD), hence there is only a sample available.
For calculations of those disorders, specific techniques have been used with on-the-fly profile generation and conditional generator similarity evaluation.
